## Bufferflow: a visualization project for Stackoverflow data

### Background

Data is the new commodity, and a ton of it exists on Stackoverflow. Making sense of this data may shed insight on current interest on technologies and the community's overall mastery of a technology based on metrics like numbers of questions answered. Bufferflow will try to present this data in a visual and interactive way by taking advantage of three.js, a webGL framework.

### Functionality & MVP  

- [ ] See questions asked as a stream of blocks that are color coded by language.
- [ ] Filter languages by typing.
- [ ] Pause the stream to inspect blocks by hovering over them with a cursor. This should show question details.
- [ ] Move forward and backward on a timeline of when the questions were asked.

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A production README

### Architecture and Technologies

**NB**: one of the main things you should be researching and deciding upon while you write this proposal is what technologies you plan to use.  Identify and create a plan of attack for the major technical challenges in your project.

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for general application logic.
- `three.js` for 3D rendering.
- `webpack` to bundle js files.

In addition to the entry file, there will be three scripts involved in this project:
